"""
Auto-generated generic tests for {"class_name": "Stream", "display_name": "stream", "import_name": "stream", "original": ["stream"], "property_name": "stream"} client.

This module contains general tests that validate the overall client
functionality, imports, error handling, and common behavior patterns
that apply across all operations without being operation-specific.
