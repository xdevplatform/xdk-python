"""
Auto-generated generic tests for {"class_name": "Webhooks", "display_name": "webhooks", "import_name": "webhooks", "original": ["webhooks"], "property_name": "webhooks"} client.

This module contains general tests that validate the overall client
functionality, imports, error handling, and common behavior patterns
that apply across all operations without being operation-specific.

Generated automatically - do not edit manually.
