"""
Auto-generated generic tests for {"class_name": "DirectMessages", "display_name": "direct messages", "import_name": "direct_messages", "original": ["direct", "messages"], "property_name": "direct_messages"} client.

This module contains general tests that validate the overall client
functionality, imports, error handling, and common behavior patterns
that apply across all operations without being operation-specific.
